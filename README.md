# Can I guess it? - Game

**Can I guess it?** is a game where the player has to think on a natural number (numbers we use to count e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4…) that is between 1 and 63, then, 6 cards will be shown and the user has to indicate where their number is on every card.

The game will always say the number you are thinking on and that's because we can count on Mofy, the mind reader. Would you dare him to make him fail? ¡Think on a number and dare Mofy! To make it more interesting don't say out loud the number you're thinking on, this way you're the only one who knows which number it is.
